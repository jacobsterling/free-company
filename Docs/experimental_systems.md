# Experimental Systems Design

## Overview

The experimental systems in Free Company add an element of chaos and discovery to the game, making every crafting attempt potentially hilarious and game-changing. These systems encourage player experimentation and create memorable moments, especially in co-op play.

## Alchemy System

### Basic Mechanics
- Players can combine various ingredients to create potions
- Each ingredient has hidden properties that are discovered through experimentation
- Quality of ingredients affects the potency and reliability of effects
- Failed experiments can create unexpected results
- Players can document successful recipes in a personal alchemy journal

### Ingredient Properties
1. **Base Effects**
   - Healing
   - Stamina restoration
   - Mana regeneration
   - Stress reduction
   - Stat buffs

2. **Hidden Properties**
   - Movement effects (speed boost/slow, direction confusion)
   - Visual effects (screen distortion, color shifts)
   - Audio effects (sound pitch changes, echo effects)
   - Control effects (inverted controls, random movements)
   - Personality effects (temporary character trait changes)

3. **Quality Levels**
   - Perfect: Maximum positive effects, no negatives
   - Good: Strong positive effects, minor negatives
   - Average: Balanced positive and negative effects
   - Poor: Weak positive effects, significant negatives
   - Failed: Mostly negative effects, minimal positives

### Experimentation Process
1. **Gathering**
   - Collect ingredients from dungeons and environment
   - Different locations yield different ingredient types
   - Seasonal variations affect ingredient properties
   - Rare ingredients found in special locations

2. **Mixing**
   - Combine ingredients in the alchemy lab
   - Order of mixing affects results
   - Temperature and timing influence outcomes
   - Special tools can modify effects

3. **Testing**
   - Try potions on characters or test subjects
   - Document all effects (both intended and unexpected)
   - Share discoveries with other players
   - Build a community knowledge base

### Co-op Interactions
- Players can prank each other with experimental potions
- Share successful recipes (or fake ones!)
- Collaborative experimentation for better results
- Competitive potion-making challenges
- Team-based discovery achievements

## Enchanting System

### Basic Mechanics
- Apply magical effects to weapons and armor
